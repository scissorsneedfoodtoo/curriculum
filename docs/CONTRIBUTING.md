## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to follow freeCodeCamp's [Code of Conduct](https://code-of-conduct.freecodecamp.org/). Please report unacceptable behavior to a moderator in the [Admin Chat Room](https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/admin).

## Need Help?

Having trouble completing one of the coding challenges? Want someone to review your code? Rather than opening an issue, the fastest way to get help is to ask in one of our [Gitter Chat Rooms](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/home) or on our [forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/). The freeCodeCamp community is very active and will be happy to assist you.

For contributing related issues, please feel free to ask in our [Contributor's Chat Room](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors). freeCodeCamp staff and contributors are often available to offer technical support there.

## Before Getting Started

freeCodeCamp is a large open source project with more than [100 repositories](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp). When you first start contributing to freeCodeCamp, you might be confused about which repository to contribute to.

Here are some of the main ones:

- [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) - The main site, https://freecodecamp.org. Things like the main index, user settings, public portfolio, certificates, heatmap, and sign-in methods are all available in this repository.

- [Learn](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/learn) - The new stand-alone web app, https://learn.freecodecamp.org. This repository is responsible for the coding environment that campers use to work through the thousands of coding challenges.

- [Curriculum](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/curriculum) - The actual challenge files that make up the freeCodeCamp curriculum. All lesson titles, descriptions, tests, translations, and default text for the coding editor can be found here.

- [Guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guide) - A massive collection of easy-to-understand articles that can be found at https://guide.freecodecamp.org. This repository also contains individual hint articles for many of the lessons that can be accessed by clicking the "Get a hint" button on each challenge's page.
